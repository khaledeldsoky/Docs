I use this role to join the worker node to the cluster
There is two way 

1. we copy the output come from the master  (join commnad) to our local machine and apply this output to the worker node
   but this way is not secure the join command have credentials data

2. we save the output come from the master  (join commnad) in Save join command in ansible cachea
